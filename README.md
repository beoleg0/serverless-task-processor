Just run Angular project.

### Angular Part

Load dependencies with `npm install`; 

Run the development server with `npm run start`

Routing wasn't included because of small project structure.

Some places like styles were not optimized and in some places there could be added error states and so on.

If it is the real project obviously more things should be added and improved in more elegant way.

I didn't implement the Refresh Table button because I added long polling to it.
